Fragile scraper for the phpBB forum python-forum.org. At the moment it simply scrapes the banned IP addresses, then reports the total banned, perecent of IPv4 addresses banned, and duplicate ban entries as well as makes the banned/dupe lists available in the global scope (nice for a python -i session).

Example output:
Total banned IPs: 1798877
Percent of IPv4 addresses: 0.042%
Total duplicate entries: 257
